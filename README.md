# Deep Dream
## Introduction
In this notebook we are going to implement **Deep Dream** algorithm in **Keras**. This algorithm allows to generate art-like images from an initial image by adding activations filters through the process of gradient ascent of the trained model:

<img src='city.jpg' style='height:320px; width:550px'>

<img src='city_dream.png' style='height:320px; width:550px'>
